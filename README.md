This repository contains a C# code example demonstrating a common error in recursive functions: an incorrect recursive step. The bug.cs file shows the flawed implementation, while bugSolution.cs provides the corrected version. The incorrect recursive step leads to incorrect results when adding two numbers recursively. The corrected version ensures correct recursive behavior by correctly decrementing only the first input.
